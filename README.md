## ttuduz_character

### This is my first React-Native project. 
### The list of screens and functions will be added soon. Looking forward to my first App!
> ### We're composed of 3 developers and 2 designers from Ewha Womans University. At first, we gathered to study and make a simple TodoList (cause TodoList is a common first step of creating an App), but things grew bigger. So we set our goal to release the app within the first half of 2021.
>> ### As one of the three developers on our team, I'm currently developing a character screen for the app. Please note that this project is only being carried out by our pure interest.
